-------------------- My Keyboard evolution -----------------
Use Mac OS X "shortcuts" per App to unify and define most frequent 
	function uses.
	
Sticky keys helps a lot, easier to tap than hold modifiers

Most keys = "best" Macros on keys for frequent functions and apps.
	Razer for 7 keys below space bar

Least keys = "best" for reduced finger movement and fatigue.

Programable:
	- Re-map Caps Lock key
	- Remapping other keys
	- SpaceFn, including Cut/Paste
	- Function key usage
	- Hyper key usage
	- Layers
	- Tap-dance
	- 1-shot modifiers
	- 1-shot Layers
	- Tap = character, hold = modifier
...
Still to come...
Better fast jumps of insertion point across characters.
	##--> goes forward ## times?
	-->, -->, --> goes forward 1, then 3, 5, 8 characters?
		time bassed??
