If a char is entered into Configurtor as 1,2,3 or ], \, ;, the shift+that char is the 
traditional shifted value: !, @, #,  or }, |, :

If dual function key (example Space / SpaceFn) is held "too long" the single character key
will not be sent.

If a key is used to get to a layer then it is unavailable on that layer.
	But it allows you to enter another layer-switch key for that position that breaks the OSL.
