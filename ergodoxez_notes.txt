Hardware:
	If you have the blank key caps wich are profiled, and the way you use 
	the thumbs ctrl, it definitly worth to make a 180 rotation of the cap.


Firmware:
	QMK firmware (a TMK fork)
	Main page. Tons of stuff, how to firmware, lots of keymaps
		http://qmk.fm/keyboards/ergodox/
	
	Industry / ErgoDox overview:
		http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergodox_keyboard_firmware.html
	
	QMK doesn't support the ATMEGA32U2 (smaller), but TMK does.
	
	The place to start for QMK, programming, layouts including: Algernon's
		http://qmk.fm/keyboards/ergodox/

	[TMK posts here https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=41989.0 ]
	
	Preferred layout and build instructions by algernon:

	Flashing QMK firmware:
		https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=82505.0
		It can flash any atmega32u4 based keyboard (Clueboard, 
		Planck/Atomic, Ergodox, and many many others) using any firmware, 
		not just QMK.
		
		Mac & Windows. Just needs your .hex file.

	Note: Karabiner-Elements (osx 10.11 & 10.12) supports modifier flags sharing 
		with all connected keyboards!	https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements

Only a handful of punctuation marks (and no digits) are available unshifted, 
and all the modifiers are on the bottom row:

   q     w     e     r     t       ||       y     u     i     o    p
   a     s     d     f     g       ||       h     j     k     l    ;
   z     x     c     v     b       ||       n     m     ,     .    /
  esc   tab  super shift bksp ctrl || alt space  fn     -     '  enter


The numbers and most of the punctuation are on the fn layer with a numpad-style 
arrangement under the right hand:

   !    @     up     {    }        ||     pgup    7     8     9    *
   #  left   down  right  $        ||     pgdn    4     5     6    +
   [    ]      (     )    &        ||       `     1     2     3    \
  L2  insert super shift bksp ctrl || alt space   fn    .     0    =


The L2 key switches it to the function layer, and tapping L0 here brings it 
back to the first layer.

 insert home    ↑    end  pgup     ||       ↑     F7    F8    F9   F10
   del  ←      ↓     →   pgdn     ||       ↓     F4    F5    F6   F11
                          reset    ||             F1    F2    F3   F12
             super shift bksp ctrl || alt space   L0
