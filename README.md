# hammerspoon_ergodox
Use Hammerspoon to configure ErgoDox EZ without reloading firmware.

* "Quick and Dirty" way to get the keyboard up to speed
* Uses technology I'm used to
* Maybe not as efficient as having the keyboard doing it
* Needs to (mostly) avoid having the behavior change for the MacBook Pro keyboard
* Designed around a "42" key keyboard.

## Current layout illustration:
![Layout](/images/ergodoxez_layout.png?raw=true "ErgoDox layout illustration")


## Todo list:
* Move any keys, as needed
	* Move/create modifier keys
	* finish off thumb clusters
	* add central Hyper & Backspace & Return
* Add press & hold support for Backspace --> Del, and Tab --> Esc.
* Navigation / Punctuation functions as mode key
* Support additional keys as Navigation / Punctuation mode keys
* Numeric / Function as mode key
* Support additional keys as Numeric / Function mode keys
* Decide: Functions on same layer as numerics? or, better yet punctuation+navigation?
* Add "Edit" keys (select all, Copy, Cut, Paste, Undo)
* Add SpaceFn functions, or keep using Karabiner.
