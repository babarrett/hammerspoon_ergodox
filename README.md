# hammerspoon_ergomac
Use Hammerspoon to configure ErgoDox EZ without reloading firmware.

* "Quick and Dirty" way to get the keyboard up to speed
* Uses technology I'm used to
* Maybe not as efficient as having the keyboard doing it
* Needs to (mostly) avoid having the behavior change for the MacBook Pro keyboard
* Designed around a "42" key keyboard.
